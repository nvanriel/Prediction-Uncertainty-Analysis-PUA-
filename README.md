====================================

Systems Biology employs mathematical modelling of biological reaction networks by systems of nonlinear differential equations. Model parameters need to be estimated using experimental data. Given the complexity of the models in combination with the limited amount of quantitative data it is important to infer how well model parameters can be determined and how uncertainty in parameters propagates into model predictions. Model identifiability and uncertainty analysis are becoming increasingly important topics in Systems Biology.
